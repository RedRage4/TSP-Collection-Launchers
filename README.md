# TSP-Collection-Launch Scripts
A few `aunch.sh` scripts for creating custom collections on the TrimUI Smart Pro

# Instructions
You may place these launch scripts and config files in the main directory for your collections. I have included a version for the base OS as well as a separate version for CrossMix-OS. They allow CrossMix-OS style ["shortcuts"](https://github.com/cizia64/CrossMix-OS/wiki/Advanced-Guides#trimui-best-collection) to roms in the official Roms folder without having to sort each of your `.txt`s into folders with the specific System key (see the explanation of how to create collections for CrossMix-OS linked above for a clearer example).
<ins>**NOTE:** If you place the roms directly into the Roms folder of your collection, you must still place them into the appropriately-named folder corresponder to the emulator core that should be used to run the rom.</ins>

If you use shortcuts you may place the shortcuts directly into the main Roms folder, or you may place them in subfolders with any names you choose. This opens up lots of possibilities for sorting into different categories or just styling the collection as you please.

Both `launch.sh` scripts and the `config.json` were adapted from the CrossMix-OS versions [launch.sh](https://github.com/cizia64/CrossMix-OS/blob/main/Best/Free%20Games%20Collection/launch.sh) [config.json](https://github.com/cizia64/CrossMix-OS/blob/main/Best/Free%20Games%20Collection/config.json)
